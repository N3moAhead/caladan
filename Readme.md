The idea is to develop a roguelike dungeon crawler in c.
The player will have to proceed through 3 Worlds, where each world holds 5 levels.
Four procedual generated levels and a fith handcraftet level with the boss fight.

The first world will be a large dungeon the player has to escape from.
The second world will be a large plain world that symbolises the way to the enemy castle.
The third world is the inside of the enemy castle.
